# Weaviate v4 Python Client Reference Files

This repository contains reference materials for the Weaviate v4 Python client, extracted and compiled from the official Weaviate documentation. These files are intended to assist developers working with Weaviate's Python client by providing detailed and condensed references with examples.

## Files

- **`reference.md`**: A comprehensive Markdown reference documenting the Weaviate v4 Python client's modules, classes, methods, and parameters. Includes a table of contents with clickable links for navigation.
- **`examples.html`**: A concise HTML reference with practical examples, linking to `reference.md` for full details. Features a table of contents and formatted code blocks for ease of use.

## Source and Extraction

These files were generated on **March 21, 2025**, by **Grok**, an AI assistant created by **xAI**, based on the official Weaviate v4 Python client documentation available at [Weaviate Python Client v4](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python). The content was extracted, structured, and enhanced with examples to improve usability.

## Usage

- **For detailed reference**: Open `reference.md` in a Markdown viewer (e.g., GitHub, VS Code) to explore the full API documentation.
- **For quick reference with examples**: Open `examples.html` in a web browser for a user-friendly overview with clickable links to `reference.md`.
- Ensure both files are in the same directory for the links in `examples.html` to function correctly.
